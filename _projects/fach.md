## **Competition Highlights**  

1. **Challenge**:  
   - Address the problem of forest fires by creating a practical and innovative solution to enhance early detection and response.  

2. **Our Approach**:  
   - Utilized **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, to develop a system capable of identifying potential fire outbreaks in real-time.  
   - Integrated our solution with existing monitoring systems for scalability and effectiveness.  
   - Iterated rapidly based on feedback to refine our prototype for practical use.  

3. **Result**:  
   - Our solution impressed the judges with its practicality and impact, earning us **3rd place** among several talented teams.  

Participating in **Dosafíos** was a valuable experience that reinforced our ability to:  
- Address critical environmental challenges using cutting-edge technology.  
- Collaborate effectively within a team under time constraints.  
- Translate ideas into actionable and impactful solutions that can help protect ecosystems and communities from the devastating effects of wildfires.
